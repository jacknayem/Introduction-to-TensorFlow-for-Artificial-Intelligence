1. What is a Convolution?
A technique to make images bigger
A technique to isolate features in images (Answer)
A technique to make images smaller
A technique to filter out unwanted images

2. What is a Pooling?
A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features (Answer)
A technique to isolate features in images
A technique to combine pictures
A technique to make images sharper

3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
They isolate features in images (Answer)
They make processing of images faster
They make the image clearer
They make the image smaller

4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
31x31
25x25
28x28
26x26 (Answer)

5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
56x56
26x26
28x28
13x13 (Answer)

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
Stay the same
Faster
Slower
It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN! (Answer)
